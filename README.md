# hyperpen-for-apple-macOS
This is not only based on but straight up duplicated from https://code.google.com/archive/p/hyperpen-for-apple/. It's been discontinued 4 years ago in 2013 and I couldn't care less if I hadn't found my old 90's Aiptek T-6000U this evening so getting this to run on macOS is yet another project to waste time on.

If you try to install the version available at Google Code it will tell you that your macOS version is too high. Running the Xcode project also didn't work so I adjusted a few bits and now it's up and running on my Sierra. Still like 3000 bugs in there, it keeps putting my cursor on my second screen and only translates the tablet's input to absolute display positions.

I think both of these issues aren't too big of a deal so you might see some updates coming in the next few days. I am probably not going to release a GUI app because Udo, the author, didn't release any code for the GUI. This means that if you want to use it, you have to download and install Xcode in order to run the project - unless you are willing to help out a bit.

No one's gonna read this anyway but now that I need this myself why not share it, too?

Cheers
